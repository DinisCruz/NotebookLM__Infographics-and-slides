│   ├── Cyber Security and Business/
│   ├── Development and Engineering/
│   ├── OSBot-Utils/
│   ├── Software and Development/
│   └── Strategic Partnerships/
│
└── to-publish/          # Queue for future publication
```

## Published Categories

- **Cyber Security and Business** - Security insights and business implications
- **Development and Engineering** - Technical development content
- **OSBot-Utils** - Framework documentation and highlights
- **Software and Development** - General software engineering content
- **Strategic Partnerships** - Collaboration and partnership insights

## Workflow

1. Create content in the main folders (`infograhics/`, `by-topic/`)
2. Copy selected pieces to `to-publish/` for LinkedIn preparation
3. After sharing, move to `published/` with appropriate categorization

## Content Guidelines

LinkedIn infographics typically work best as:
- Single-page PNG images
- Clear, scannable layouts
- Focused on a single key insight or takeaway
