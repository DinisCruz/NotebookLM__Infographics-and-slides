## Key Themes

- **Pass-Driven Development**: Testing without breaking the build - start with passing tests even for known bugs
- **Runtime Type Safety**: OSBot-Utils Type_Safe primitives enforce correctness at runtime
- **Synergy**: PDD + Type_Safe create a development paradigm optimized for resilience
- **Real-World Application**: Examples from HTML Graph and MGraph-DB projects
- **Consumer-Aligned**: Tests derived from actual user scenarios, types reflecting business rules
