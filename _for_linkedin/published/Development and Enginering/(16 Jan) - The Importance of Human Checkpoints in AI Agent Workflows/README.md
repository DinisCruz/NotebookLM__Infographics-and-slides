## Key Themes

- **Autonomous Agent Risks**: Real-world horror stories of AI agents causing catastrophic failures
- **Delegation with Checkpoints**: Traditional workflows always included review stages
- **Feedback Loops**: A feature, not a bug - iterative refinement improves outcomes
- **Best Practices**: Least-privilege access, human approval for critical actions, incremental delegation
- **Trust but Verify**: The formula for success with AI agents
