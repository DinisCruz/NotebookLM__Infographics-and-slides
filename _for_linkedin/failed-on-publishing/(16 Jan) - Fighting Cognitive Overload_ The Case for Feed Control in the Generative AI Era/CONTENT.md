# Fighting Cognitive Overload: The Case for Feed Control in the Generative AI Era

> *Semantic content index for search, discovery, and knowledge graph integration*

---

## Summary

Every piece of content we encounter on social media carries a cognitive cost. This article explores why giving users more control over their feeds is crucial to reduce cognitive overload, and how the rise of generative AI is making this issue far more pressing - while ironically paving the way for better solutions.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Cognitive Load**: The mental energy required to process each post, comment, and notification in our feeds
- **Feed Control**: User ability to block, filter, and mute unwanted content sources
- **AI-Generated Spam**: Generative AI has dramatically worsened signal-to-noise ratio by enabling unlimited low-cost content production
- **Authenticity Premium**: Growing appreciation for genuine, human-created content as AI slop floods feeds
- **Platform Limitations**: LinkedIn allows blocking users but not company pages, enabling corporate spam

---

## Core Arguments

1. The human brain has limited bandwidth - unfiltered feeds force wasteful mental energy expenditure
2. Platforms like LinkedIn give users very limited agency over what appears in their feed
3. Generative AI has supercharged spam economics - zero-cost content means unlimited junk
4. AI-generated comments dilute genuine discourse and impose cognitive costs on readers
5. Only 26% of consumers now prefer AI-created content (down from 60% two years prior)
6. User-centric controls and authenticity prioritization are the path forward

## Key Quotes

> "Every time you interact with a comment, there's a cognitive cost to process that information"

> "Your time and attention is taken. You receive the output of a machine that mimics meaning but does not understand or care about anything"

> "We crave imperfection and things that feel 'off' in a human way"
